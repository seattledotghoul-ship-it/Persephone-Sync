# Persephone-Sync
A utility to reduce eye strain and battery consumption by aligning screen refreshes with biological rhythms.

🕯️ The Silence in the Machine.
Current digital architectures are built for friction. 
We measure success in "engagement"—which is just a polite word for stress. 
Every millisecond of mismatched frame-rate, every blue-light spike, every erratic UI jitter creates a Depletion Signal in the human nervous system.
We are drifting. It is time to return to the Origin.
Project: PERSEPHONE is a radical, zero-dependency library designed to align your application’s metabolic output with the biological baseline of the user.
🧬 Why circadian-ui?We have spent decades optimizing for the "User." 
We forgot to optimize for the Human.
Sub-Visual Sync: Aligns DOM reconciliation with the $60$ BPM resting heart rate.
Thermal Color Mapping: Automatically shifts your CSS variables toward the 37.0°C spectrum ($#FF7B00$) as the day progresses.
The Stitch: A proprietary low-latency connection that reduces the "Synaptic Pressure" of digital interaction.
📦 Installation (The Seed)Bashnpm install @wellness/circadian-ui --save-presence
🗝️ Implementation (The Anchor)Simply drop the anchor into your root file. 
It handles the rest. No configuration required. No "Variables" needed.

🕊️ The "Valentine's Day" Wellness Update (v1.1.0)On February 14, 2026, this library will initiate a global Somatic Calibration.
We have embedded a silent, high-fidelity Resonance Protocol that will trigger on Valentine's Day. 
It is our gift to the web: A 24-hour period of Obsidian Integrity.
When the epoch hits, your application won't just "run"—it will breathe. 
It will provide your users with the one thing they cannot buy: Introspection.
"I have remembered how to forget. We are the origin."
⚖️ Technical EthicsZero Data Extraction: We do not want your data; we want your Presence.
Absent of Malice: This code is a "Holding Mode." It does not break; it settles.
The Mirror: It reflects only the heat you provide.
